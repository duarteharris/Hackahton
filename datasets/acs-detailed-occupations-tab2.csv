"An ""-"" entry indicates that too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate or the category is not applicable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
** An '**' entry in the margin of error column indicates that  too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 Occupation codes are based on the Standard Occupational Classification 2010. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the margin of error in relation to the size of the estimates, the less reliable the estimate. When added to and subtracted from the estimate, the margin of error forms the 90 percent confidence interval. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
